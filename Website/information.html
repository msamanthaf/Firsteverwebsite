      <p><strong>Where?</strong><br>
	              As satellite  data of the fire hotspots shows,  forest fires have affected the length and breadth of Indonesia. Among the worst  hit areas are southern Kalimantan (Borneo) and western Sumatra. The fires  have been raging since July, with efforts to  extinguish them hampered by seasonal dry conditions exacerbated by the El Nino  effect. As well as Indonesia, the acrid haze from the fires isengulfing  neighboring Malaysia and Singapore and  has reached as far as southern  Thailand.<br>
  <strong>What is the damage?</strong><br>
	              The most obvious  damage is to the forest where the fires are occurring.Indonesia's  tropical forests represent some of the most  diverse habitats on the planet. The current  fire outbreak adds to decades of existing  deforestation by palm oil, timber and other agribusiness operators, further imperiling  endangered species such  as the orangutan.<br>
	              The human cost  is that 19  people have died and an estimated >500,000  cases of respiratory tract infections  have been reported since the start of the fires. It is estimated that the fires  could cause more  than 100,000 premature deaths in  the region.<br>
	              Financial  damage to the region&rsquo;s economy is still being counted, but the Indonesian  government's own estimates suggest it could be as  high as $47billion, a huge blow to the country's economy. A World Bank study on forest fires last year in Riau province  estimated that they caused $935m of losses relating to lost agricultural  productivity and trade.<br>
  <strong>What is causing the fires?</strong><br>
	              Forest fires  have become a seasonal phenomenon in Indonesia. At the root of the problem is  the practice of forest clearance known as slash  and burn, where land is set on fire as a  cheaper way to clear it for new  planting. Peat soil, which characterizes  much of the affected areas, is highly flammable, causing localized fires to  spread and making them difficult to stop.</p>

                  <strong>Who is responsible?</strong><br>
                  It's a blame  game, with everyone pointing the finger at someone else. Environmental  group, which has been highlighting the problem of Indonesia recurrent fires for years, says that the fires are caused by the collective  negligence of companies, smallholders and government (which is investing  sufficiently in preventative measures).<br>
                  Many blame big  business. According to a recent analysis of World Resources Institute data in September, more than  one third (37%) of the fires in Sumatra are occurring on pulpwood concessions.  A good proportion of the rest are on or near land  used by palm oil producers. Many of  these fires are a direct result of the industrial manipulation of the landscape  for plantation development says  Lindsey Allen, executive director of the  conservation organization Rainforest Action Network.<br>
                  In September,  the Indonesian police arrested seven executives in connection with the fires,  including a senior executive from Bumi Mekar Hijau (BMH), which supplied  Jakarta-based paper giant Asia Pulp and Paper (APP).<br>
                  Others look  away from the big corporations for blame. According to Henry Purnomo, professor  at Indonesia&rsquo;s Bogor Agricultural University and a scientist at research group  CIFOR, there are two culprits: poor small-scale farmers looking to expand their  farmland, and rogue operators intent on illegally clearing forests for land  acquisition.<br>
                  Global  corporations operating in the area also blame smallholders and under-the-radar  companies. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which counts many big palm  oil businesses as members, has consistently said that the instances of fire on  certified palm plantations in the affected region (which number 137) measure in  single digits. Brendan May, chairman of sustainability advisory firm  Robertsbridge (which has APP as a client), argues that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not in companies&rsquo;  best interest&rdquo; to set fire to their own assets – an argument&nbspsome  campaign groups dispute</a>.<br>
  <strong>What needs to be done?</strong><br>
                  Ending the  practice of slash and burn is vital. Companies – big and small - must be held  to account, before the law and the market, if found culpable.<br>
                  Smallholders  need assistance and incentives to pursue alternative, less harmful practices of  forest management. Forest-dwelling communities often lack the skills and  training, according to a recent CIFOR  report</a>. Meanwhile processors and buyers  often fail to pay smallholders a fair price, something the signatories to the  Sustainable Palm Oil Manifesto (which claims to go beyond RSPO certification standards)  have pledged to correct.<br>
                  Many big firms,  such as palm producer&nbsp;Wilmar</a>&nbsp;and timber giant APP, have signed&nbsp;zero-deforestation  pledges</a>&nbsp;in recent years. But the real  test comes in pushing their commitments beyond the boundary fences of their plantations  and down into their supply chains, where smaller firms operate with less public  scrutiny.<br>
  <strong>As 2019 begins…</strong><br>
                  … We&rsquo;re asking readers to make a new  year contribution in support of The Guardian&rsquo;s independent journalism. More  people are reading and supporting our independent, investigative reporting than  ever before. And unlike many news organizations, we have chosen an approach  that allows us to keep our journalism open and accessible to all, regardless of  where they live or what they can afford. But this is only possible thanks to  voluntary support from our readers – something we have to maintain and build on  for every year to come.<br>
                  Flame Guardian is editorially  independent, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from  commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or  shareholders. No one edits our editor. No one steers our opinion. This is  important as it enables us to give a voice to those less heard, challenge the  powerful and hold them to account. It&rsquo;s what makes us different to so many  others in the media, at a time when factual, honest reporting is critical.<br>
                  Please make a new year contribution  today to help us deliver the independent journalism the world needs for 2019  and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
